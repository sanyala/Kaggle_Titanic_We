Predict survival on the Titanic (with tutorials in Excel, Python, R, and an introduction to Random Forests) 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, 
during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers 
and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the 
passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of 
people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.  
In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a 
lot of experience in data science and machine learning. The data is highly structured and we provide 3 
tutorials of increasing complexity.  Please use the forums freely and as much as you like.
There is no such thing as a stupid question; we guarantee someone else will be wondering the same thing!
Variables in the data:
PassengerId
Survived
Pclass
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp
Parch
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked
There are two datasets - train.csv with 891 obs and test.csv with 418 obs. The train.csv has the dependent measure - 
survived and the test.csv does not have that field.
